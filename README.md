# ONTOLOGIES: OWL + WIDOCO + NETLIFY
This project describes the two ontologies used by https://www.datavillage.me to build the Digital Twins of people and to process these Digital Twins in a fully transparent way.
This project uses WIDICO (https://github.com/dgarijo/Widoco) to generate documentation of ontologies.
The generated ontology websites are automatically deployed on https://www.netlify.com.

## Ontology digital-twin (ONGOING WORK)
It defines the way personal data are organised in the five Digital Twins.
- SOCIAL
